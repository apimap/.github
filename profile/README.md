This is the home of the Apimap.io project, a freestanding solution to keep track of all functionality a company
provides through an API. It is a push based system, connected with your build pipeline or manually updated using our CLI.

> **Application programming interface (API)**: Point of functional integration between two or more systems connected 
> through commonly known standards

**Why is this project useful?** Lost track of all the API functionality provided inside your organization? Don't want
to be tied to an API proxy or management solution? The Apimap.io project uploads, indexes and enables discoverability of all
your organizations APIs. We care about the source code, removing the limitation of where the API is hosted and how your
network is constructed.
